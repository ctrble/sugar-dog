## Gameplay

### Start of the Game

- map size is determined by # of players
  - each player adds 4 to the width and height of the map
    - 2 players: 8 x 8
    - 3 players: 12 x 12
    - 4 players: 16 x 16
    - etc
  - draw the game map
- each player begins by selecting a position on the map
- record your starting position on the grid

### Playing the Game

- each player takes turns giving commands and determining results
- record actions and contacts in the command log as needed

### How to Win

- the last surviving submarine wins
- if no submarines survive then the game ends in a draw

## Submarine Captain's Guide

### Command Log

- the captain of each submarine is responsible for keeping accurate records of each turn
- they must track their own position, commands given, and active mine and torpedo positions
- they are advised to track all contacts each turn

### Submarines

- equipped with sonar, torpedos, and 2 mines
- if a submarine enters the same space as another contact, both are destroyed

### Torpedos

- each turn, move 2 spaces in a straight line
- announce first space, then second space
- do respond to active sonars
- if a torpedo enters the same space as a submarine or another contact
  - announce an impact
  - everything in that space is destroyed

### Mines

- each submarine starts the game with 2 mines
- place a mine at a position
- do respond to active sonars
- if another contact moves into the space a mine is in
  - announce an impact
  - everything in that space is destroyed

### Sonar

- passive sonar detects loud contacts, such as fast moving submarines and torpedos
- active sonar detects all submarines, mines, and torpedos
  - except submarines in stealth mode
  - if you used the active sonar, you are revealed (even if previously in stealth mode)

### Actions

#### Stealth Mode

- do nothing
- undetectable, do not respond to other active sonars, but do announce your own position if you use active sonar

#### Silent Running

- move 1 space
- do not announce position
- do respond to active sonars

#### Cruise

- move 2 spaces
- announce first space, then second space
- do respond to active sonars

#### Fire Torpedos

- announce torpedo position
- torpedos move at 2 spaces per turn
- announce first space, then second space
- do respond to active sonars

#### Place Mine (if available)

- remove 1 mine from inventory
- do not announce position
- mines do not move
- if another contact moves into the space a mine is in
    - announce an impact
    - everything in that space is destroyed
- do respond to active sonars

#### Active Sonar

- announce position/s
    - include yourself and any active torpedoes
    - announce yourself first, then announce mine and torpedo positions
    - list the positions closest to the sonar source first
- request responses
    - when responding, announce yourself and your active mines and torpedos
    - list the positions closest to the sonar source first

## FAQ

- can a submarine occupy the same space of another submarine or mine?
  - yes, if the submarine is silent running or in stealth mode, meaning it's moving carefully and potentially at a different depth, thus avoiding collisions with nearby objects

## Notes

- perhaps can remove stealth mode, easily abused, not accurate. instead, when using silent running the player may move up to 1 space
